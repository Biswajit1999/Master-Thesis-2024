## Project Title: **Closed Loop Feedback Control System for ExohSpec Development**

**Summary:**
- This project aimed to address challenges in achieving high-resolution radial velocity spectroscopy, particularly for identifying habitable Earth-like exoplanets.
- The research focused on developing a closed-loop feedback control system as an alternative to vacuum chambers for instrument stability.
- Findings from experimental analyses highlighted the importance of environmental stability and the impact of temperature, humidity, and pressure on optical path length variations.
- Methodologies employed included air refraction compensation techniques and the use of modified Edlen equations for calculating compensated path length.
- Results revealed the relationship between atmospheric pressure changes and optical path length variations, along with the efficacy of different models in predicting geometric path length.
- Limitations and areas for improvement included challenges with air density gradients and temperature differentials within the enclosure.
- Future developments may involve refining the closed-loop control system, integrating pressure stability mechanisms, and implementing real-time monitoring through web-based interfaces.
- Overall, the project lays the groundwork for future advancements in high-resolution radial velocity spectroscopy, contributing to our understanding of the universe and the search for habitable exoplanets.

**Note:**
- The GitHub repository contains all necessary codes used during experimental analyses, which will be regularly updated.
- Data files are not provided, but can be made available upon request for further analysis.
